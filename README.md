# FinalP
final project
The last part of the project, The items can be collected, the enemy follows you and there is music and damage sound effects.
A second stage was in development but due to setbacks, was ultimatly scraped. Idea wise after all the items in the initial level are collect a wall opens to a 
second segment with it's own platform and more items to collect.
The final final unity project is final-2-stay.
